Thanks for trying Ground Control LUTs!

In this folder you'll find the normal .CUBE LUT.

In the "Additional Formats" folder you'll find .3DL and .mga LUTs.

If your program of choice doesn't read .CUBE files, try one of the other ones!

LUT Buddy by Red Giant reads .3DL files and is compatible with Adobe software back to CS3 as well as FCP7 and more!

Apple color should read .mga files.

If you need an additional format, let us know at info@groundcontrolcolor.com and we'll try to make one for you!

Thanks!
